Sustainability

What is sustainable development?
--------------------------------

The origin of the concept of *sustainability* are remote and can be followed
through the history of political philosophy [1], but in recent years, the term
has become a *buzzword* with unclear meaning [1, 2].

In 1987, in the UN's Brundtland Report established the political framework for
work in this field, and provided the following widely-accepted definition [3, 8]:

> "Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present
> without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."

In 2015, the UN produced a list of 17 *Goals* as to be "a blueprint to achieve a
better and more sustainable future for all" [4]:

1.  End poverty in all its forms everywhere.
2.  End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote
    sustainable agriculture.
3.  Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
4.  Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong
    learning opportunities for all.
5.  Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.
6.  Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for
    all.
7.  Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.
8.  Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and
    productive employment and decent work for all.
9.  Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable
    industrialization and foster innovation.
10. Reduce inequality within and among countries.
11. Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and
    sustainable.
11. Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.
13. Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
14. Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for
    sustainable development.
15. Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems,
    sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse
    land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.
16. Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development,
    provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and
    inclusive institutions at all levels.
17. Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership
    for Sustainable Development.

*The 17 Sustainable Development Goals defined by the UN [4].*

To further clarify the Goals, the UN provided a list of *Targets* for each goal,
for a total of 169 [4]. While some of the Targets apply in practice only to
developing countries, others are much more general. For example, consider the
following one:

> "Improve progressively [...] global resource efficiency in consumption
> and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental
> degradation [...]."

This Target could apply to developing countries as well as to economically
depressed peripheral areas of developed countries. In both cases,
non-sustainable development imposes a choice between jobs and pollution, often
hiding under supposed *sustainability* for the financial benefits of
speculators [5, 6].

The adjective *sustainable* has multiple meanings and, similarly,
sustainable development has multiple aspects. One of these aspects is that it's
not enough for it to be *endurable* given the available resources.
Sustainable development also needs to be a *long-term plan of
improvement*. A definition of sustainability [7], complementary of that of
sustainable development provided by the UN [3], highlights this duality:

> "Sustainability is the practice of maintaining world processes of productivity
> indefinitely — natural or human-made — by replacing resources used with
> resources of equal or greater value without degrading or endangering natural
> biotic systems."

Considering this new definition, one deduces that policies based on perpetual
state aid cannot be regarded as sustainable development.


What is computational sustainability?
-------------------------------------

Computational sustainability is applying computer science towards sustainable
development, to fields like ecology, economics, and social studies. The
computational sustainability community shares the following vision [8]:

> "Our vision is that computer scientists can and should play a key role in
> helping address societal and environmental challenges in pursuit of a
> sustainable future, while also advancing computer science as a discipline."

Computational sustainability isn't only for computer scientists, though. To be
successful, computational sustainability needs the collaboration of a large
number of experts in social, environmental and natural sciences [8].

The following are some examples of work done in the field of computational
sustainability.

- An optimised rebalancing of the NYC bike-sharing fleet using crowdsourcing
  [9].
- The Dark Ecology project, which extracts biological information from weather
  data to determine the abundance and occurrence of bird species [10].
- An artificial intelligence that helps understand patterns in wildlife poaching
  to combat this phenomenon, a system tested and deployed in Malaysia, Botswana
  and China [11].
- The Global Forest Watch project, which monitors deforestation and forest fires
  throughout the globe [12].


Why Sardinia?
-------------

Sardinia is the second-largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, It has a
population of about 1.6 million people, mostly belonging to the local ethnic
group: the Sardinians. [13].

The Sardinians are an ethnic group within Italy similarly to how the Welsh, the
Scots, and the Irish are ethnic groups within the British Islands. Although
today Italian is the most spoken language on the Sardinia, the local Sardinian
language is still spoken, especially in the northern part of the island.
Sardinian is an autonomous Romance language that does not belong to the family
of italic languages [14]. Other languages spoken in Sardinia are: Catalan,
Gallurese, Sassarese, and Tabarkin. This diversity gives the island rich
cultural traditions and a strong identity, but Italianisation, which had its
peak during the fascist era of the 1920s, has – and still is –
eroding this rich cultural texture [14, 15]. This is because the population
associates the Italian language with promises of improvement of their economic
conditions, at the cost of cultural alienation [15, 17]. This process of
*cultural cringe* shows why the social and economic situation of Sardinia
can be described with the tools provided by postcolonial studies [16, 17],
similarly to what has been done for Scotland [18].

After the Second World War, Sardinia was one of the poorest regions in the whole
of Europe. Starting from the 1950s, the induced industrialisation of the
*Renaissance plan* improved the economic conditions of the inhabitants,
but the improvement slowed down at the beginning of the 1970s until it stopped
altogether [19]. Today, both the island's income per capita and its employment
rate are well below the Italian and the European averages [20].

The results of non-sustainable development policies in Sardinia are visible.
About half of the territory of Sardinia is threatened by the desertification
process, and groundwater resources are quantitatively more than surface water.
However, the concentration of nitrates in the water is higher than the allowed
threshold according to EU regulations, mainly due to pollution [21]. Considering
the state of degradation of the soil in the areas of now-closed mines, a report
to the UN's Food And Agriculture Organization (FAO) makes a stark remark [22]:

> "The soils involved, initially highly fertile, have been irreversibly
> contaminated. The superficial horizons now show high values of lead, and
> significant amounts of zinc, manganese and cadmium."

Non-sustainable tourism has also become an environmental problem [22]:

> "The tapping of aquifers in coastal areas, which has skyrocketed with the boom
> in tourism, is not properly managed. Unfortunately, the excessive drain on
> underground water has altered the balance with marine waters, provoking saline
> intrusions that contaminate aquifers and cause saline deposits on soils."

Also, Sardinia hosts a large number of military sites, in particular weapon test
ranges, which are a danger both to the health of the people living nearby and
the ecosystem [23, 24].

For all these reasons, Sardinia desperately needs actual sustainable development
policies, before it's too late.
