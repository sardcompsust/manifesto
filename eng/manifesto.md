The Manifesto
=============

A. What we do and why we do it
------------------------------

1.  We create software to enable sustainable development in Sardinia because we
    believe technology has a role to play in address societal and environmental
    challenges.
2.  We use the techniques of *data science* to improve the understanding of
    Sardinian environment, economics, and society because we think successful
    development can only come from good understanding.
3.  We open our work and resources to all disciplines because we think only by
    carrying out interdisciplinary work we can address the challenges of
    sustainable development.
4.  We empower local communities in Sardinia through our work, because we think
    that development can be sustainable only if supported by local communities
    *from within*.
5.  We work for the Sardinian community and only for it because we want to keep
    our efforts focused.
6.  To make sure our efforts are focused on our aims, we attain to the following
    definition: sustainable development is development that 
    * replaces any resources (natural and human-made) with resources of equal or
      greater value,       
    * does not compromise one type of resource for another,
    * can be maintained indefinitely,
    * does not require state aid for its maintenance, 
    * provides full-time jobs to people in the community,
    * keeps any financial revenue within the community.
7.  We support other organisations and initiatives that align with what we do
    because our success depends on their success too.
8.  We inform institutions, to make sure they have accurate data to take the
    best decisions.
9.  We inform the public to make sure they are aware of our efforts and they're
    aware of what is happening in the community and environment. To do this, we
    use clear, simple language.
10. We attain to high technical standards because we want to make sure what we
    do can be both used and maintained as easily as possible.
11. We produce rigorous work because we want it to matter. We want our impact to
    be as high as possible.
12. We believe culture is a form of human-made resource, and we want to add
    value to Sardinian culture by using and increasing the prestige of Sardinian
    languages. For this reason:
    * we use English and any local Sardinian language for internal written
      communication,
    * we use English, any local Sardinian language, and Italian for external
      written communication,
    * we use any local Sardinian language as much as possible for all
      communication,
    * for "Sardinian local language" we mean anyone of the following: Sardinian
      (either in the Logudorese or Campidanese varieties), Catalan, Gallurese,
      Sassarese, or Tabarkin. The only important thing is that the text is
      written correctly, according to published orthographic rules.
13. We aim to be a blueprint for other initiatives in the world because the
    consequences of non-sustainable development, environmental degradation in
    particular, affect all the communities in the world.
14. We accept any contribution from anybody so long as we don't have to
    compromise with the contents of this Manifesto. This is because we need to
    get all the help we can to achieve our aims.

B. What we don't do and why we don't do it
------------------------------------------

1. We don't do any work that doesn't involve computing or data analysis at all,
   because we want to focus our efforts.
2. We don't carry out work under request for specific companies because we're
   not a company ourselves.
3. We don't produce closed-source software because we want our work to be useful
   to as many people as possible. However, we can *use* non-open-source software
   as we see fit.
4. The initiative does not affiliate with political parties because we don't
   want doubts to be cast on the rigour of our work.
5. We do not develop military applications.
6. We do not work on anything that supports any form of perpetual state aid
   (*assistenzialismo*) because we don't think that is sustainable development.
7. We don't develop anything that supports non-sustainable development in any of
   its forms.

C. Our values
-------------

The following are the *values* we apply to everything we do within the
initiative.

#### Reason
We are guided by reason. We justify what we do with rigorous arguments to the
best of our abilities. We want to be objective and we do not allow our work to
be affected by our personal convictions.

#### Empathy
We empathise with the people we interact with. We provide constructive feedback
in a respectful way because the whole initiative benefits from the personal
growth and the learning of each participant. We recognise and cherish
contribution.

#### Selflessness
We do not aim to achieve political or economic benefit from our work within the
initiative.
