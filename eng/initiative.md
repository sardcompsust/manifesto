The initiative
==============

Sardinia Sustainability wants to be a network of people who work towards
sustainable development in Sardinia by analysing and visualising data. The
initiative is open to everybody and it's multi-disciplinary, involving a range
of subjects: from ecology to linguistics, from economics to archaeology.

How the initiative works
------------------------

The initiative has a structured collection of projects, mostly software
projects, that follow the same manifesto, and relate to each other. There's a
*coordinator* who follows the whole initiative, and a *project coordinator* for
each project. Most projects are on
[GitHub](https://github.com/sardiniasustainability) and whoever wants can
contribute freely, without feeling attached to the initiative, if they don't
want to.

How to help
-----------

Whoever wants to help can:
* take a look at the projects on the website or on 
  [GitHub](https://github.com/sardiniasustainability), and contribute in the
  same way as any open-source project.
* propose a project, by [sending an email to Sardinia Sustainability's
  address](mailto:sardiniasustainability@mail.com).
