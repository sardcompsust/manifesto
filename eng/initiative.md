The initiative
==============

Sardinia Sustainability wants to be a network of people who work towards
sustainable development in Sardinia, above all "technical people": engineers,
computer, natural, and social scientists, mathematicians, economists, medics...

How the initiative works
------------------------

The initiative has a structure collection of projects that follow the same
manifesto, and communicate with each other. There's a *coordinator* who follows
the whole initiative, and a *project coordinator* for each project. Most
projects are on [GitHub](https://github.com/sardiniasustainability) and whoever
wants can contribute freely, without feeling attached to the initiative, if they
don't want to.

How to help
-----------

Whoever wants to help can:
* take a look at the projects in
  [GitHub](https://github.com/sardiniasustainability), and contribute in the
  same way as any open-source project.
* propose a project, by [sending an email to Sardinia Sustainability's
  address](mailto:sardiniasustainability@mail.com).
